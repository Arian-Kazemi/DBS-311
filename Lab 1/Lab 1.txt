Assignment Content

Lab Instruction:
Answer each question in the provided space.
You must include the solution (SQL Statement) and the output of the query for each question.
quote you code and output in a code snippet
See the following example:

SELECT order_id, customer_id
 FROM orders
WHERE order_id < 5
ORDER BY order_id;
 
  ORDER_ID CUSTOMER_ID
---------- -----------
         1           4
         2           4
         3           5
         4           8
To generate the result like the above output, select the SQL statement, use the "Run Script" button to execute the query, and copy the result from the output box to the answer box in your lab. If one column is too long, use the following command to format the output.

COLUMN city FORMAT A20;
'city' is your column name, A20 means you want your column to be 20 char long. You should set it accordingly. Make sure your code does not generate errors before submitting a solution.



Style Guide:

Your SQL should be written using the standard coding style:
all keywords are to be upper case,
all user-defined names are to be lower case, (example: table and field names)
there should be a carriage return before each major part of the SQL statements (i.e. before SELECT, FROM, WHERE and ORDER BY)
